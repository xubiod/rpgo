# RPGO

This is currently a direct translation of uuksuu's RPGMakerDecrypter project,
specifically the Decrypter namespace and the Tests namespace. You can go to that
version [here](https://github.com/uuksu/RPGMakerDecrypter/).

This was mainly an exercise with Go and the testing capabilities. All current
tests pass. As of writing I want to implement more tests, as current coverage is
at 58.9%.
